# Data Analysis for BRFSS2015-Data
### Topic
This study examines the impact of health factors like BMI, general health, and lifestyle on heart disease, stroke, and diabetes across different age groups using BRFSS 2015 data.

### Methodology
The dataset was analyzed by categorizing age and BMI, calculating entropy and mutual information to identify key health indicators, and exploring interaction effects between variables such as BMI, mental health, and income. Stacked histograms visualized age-related health trends.

### Tools
- Python
- Entropy and Mutual Information: Used to measure the importance of health indicators across age groups.
- Stacked Histograms: Visualized health trends like general health, BMI, and high blood pressure across different age groups.


### Results
- General Health: The most important factor for predicting disease, especially for seniors.
- Age Trends: Younger adults showed better health, while seniors faced more health challenges like high blood pressure and difficulty walking.
- Interactions: Strong links were found between BMI, mental health, and income, affecting disease risk.
